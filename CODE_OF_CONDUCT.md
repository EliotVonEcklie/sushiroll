- **Focusing on Collaboration:** Strive to collaborate with others, fostering a community built on mutual respect.

- **Showing Empathy:** Be empathetic to the experiences of other community members.

- **Respecting Privacy:** Respect the privacy and confidentiality of others.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- **Trolling and Disruptive Behavior:** Deliberate attempts to disrupt discussions or create a negative atmosphere are not allowed.

- **Personal Attacks:** Personal attacks or derogatory comments directed at individuals or groups are not permitted.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [eliotvonecklie@email.com](mailto:eliotvonecklie@email.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
