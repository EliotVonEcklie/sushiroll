## Reporting a Vulnerability

At Sushiroll, we take security seriously. If you discover any security issues or vulnerabilities within the project, please report them to our security team by emailing [eliotvonecklie@email.com](mailto:eliotvonecklie@email.com). We appreciate your responsible disclosure, and we will work to promptly address and fix the issue.

## Expectations

- Provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce if possible.
- Allow reasonable time for the maintainers to address the issue before disclosing it publicly.
- Understand that this is an open-source project developed by a community of volunteers, and response times may vary.

## Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible disclosure, and we will make every effort to acknowledge and address the reported vulnerabilities promptly. We appreciate the contributions of security researchers and the broader community in helping us maintain a secure environment for all users.
